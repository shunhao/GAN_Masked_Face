# GAN_Masked_Face

## Introduction
Facial recognition has been used everywhere today. However, during the COVID pandemic, as people are wearing masks everywhere, it is hard for facial recognition algorithms to achieve a high accuracy. As researchers are implementing and developing new algorithms for masked faces, usually naive simulated masked face images are being used for training. These images do not look real. A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a class of machine learning frameworks, where two neural networks contest with each other in a game. GAN has been widely used to produce realistic sythesized images, for example, CycleGAN for transferring image styles, StarGAN for changing facial expression and attributes. Therefore, we would like to develop a GANbased masked face image generator to make a better simulation and other researchers would benefit from better quality data.
